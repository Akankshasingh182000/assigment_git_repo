# assigment_git_repo
1. To accomplish this task, I have used a python programming language.

2.I have written a Python program that reads a file containing employee records and identifies employees who meet the specified criteria.

3.This program assumes that your input file is structured in a specific way, with each line containing either employee information (name and position) or shift records (start time and end time) separated by commas. The program then parses the data and checks for the specified criteria for each employee. Make sure to adjust the file format to match your specific input data.
